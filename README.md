# FastAPI Beyond CRUD 🚀

This repository is a comprehensive record of my learning journey through Jonathan Salli’s *FastAPI Beyond CRUD* playlist. The goal of this repo is to move past the basics of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and dive into the advanced features that make FastAPI a powerful framework for building modern, production-ready APIs. While CRUD operations are the foundation of most applications, real-world systems demand much more — authentication, authorization, background tasks, WebSockets, database migrations, testing, and deployment strategies. This repo captures my exploration of those advanced topics in a structured, well-documented way.

The projects here are built with **Python 3.10+**, **FastAPI**, **Uvicorn**, **SQLAlchemy**, and **Pydantic**, using a clean setup with my `fbcenv` virtual environment. Each module is organized to highlight a specific concept, such as role-based access control, async database operations, or event-driven communication. I’ve included annotated notes, Jupyter notebooks, and markdown explanations to ensure clarity and reproducibility. This makes the repo not only a personal learning resource but also a recruiter-friendly showcase of technical hygiene and professional presentation.

By following along with the playlist, I’ve structured the repo to demonstrate incremental growth: starting from simple endpoints, then layering in middleware, dependency injection, and background tasks, before tackling more complex features like WebSockets for real-time communication and Alembic migrations for database evolution. I’ve also emphasized testing practices, CI/CD workflows, and deployment strategies to cloud environments, ensuring that the applications here are not just demos but can serve as blueprints for production-ready systems.

Ultimately, this repository reflects my commitment to building scalable, maintainable, and well-documented FastAPI projects. It is both a personal bootcamp and a professional portfolio piece, showing how I approach learning with clarity, reproducibility, and recruiter visibility in mind. Whether you’re a fellow learner, a collaborator, or a recruiter, this repo demonstrates my ability to go beyond CRUD and tackle the challenges of real-world API development with FastAPI.
